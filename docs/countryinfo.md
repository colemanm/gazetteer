 Currencies :
 ============

 A number of territories are not included in ISO 4217, because their currencies are not per se an independent currency,
 but a variant of another currency. These currencies are:

 1. FO : Faroese krona (1:1 pegged to the Danish krone)
 2. GG : Guernsey pound (1:1 pegged to the pound sterling)
 3. JE : Jersey pound (1:1 pegged to the pound sterling)
 4. IM : Isle of Man pound (1:1 pegged to the pound sterling)
 5. TV : Tuvaluan dollar (1:1 pegged to the Australian dollar).
 6. CK : Cook Islands dollar (1:1 pegged to the New Zealand dollar).

 The following non-ISO codes are, however, sometimes used: GGP for the Guernsey pound,
 JEP for the Jersey pound and IMP for the Isle of Man pound (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217)


 A list of currency symbols is available here : http://forum.geonames.org/gforum/posts/list/437.page

 Languages :
 ===========

 The column 'languages' lists the languages spoken in a country ordered by the number of speakers. The language code is a 'locale'
 where any two-letter primary-tag is an ISO-639 language abbreviation and any two-letter initial subtag is an ISO-3166 country code.

 Example : es-AR is the Spanish variant spoken in Argentina.
